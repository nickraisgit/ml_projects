Project: ***Using a U-Net Autoencoder Model for Multi-Class Semantic Segmentation on BraTS2021 data from kaggle***

This project is creating a novel U-Net Autoencoder architecture for Multi-Class Semantic Segmentation for MRI images pulled from Kaggle's BraTS 2021 dataset. Categories are GD-enhancing tumor (label 4), peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue (label 2), and necrotic tumor core (label 1). 0.076 categorical crossentropy loss on holdout dataset.
