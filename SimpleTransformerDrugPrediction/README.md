Project: ***Using a Simple Transformer Model to Predict Solubility of Drugs.***

Data sourced from ZINC 250k drug database and all data is displayed in SMILES format. Using NLP based transformer model with multiheaded attention and Bidirectional layers used after the transformer blocks. Using warm-up learning rate scheduler. Simple regression task, has better results compared to a simple NLP classifier.
